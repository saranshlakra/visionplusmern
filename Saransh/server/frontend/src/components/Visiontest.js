                      <p>
                      In near vision test, we set up a screen with different text that is similar to clinical test. All the lines are of different size. If you can read all the line without any problem then you probably have a good vision.
                      This test result is based on data that we collected from many perfect vision people. By doing this test you are comparing your vision with people who has 6/6 or perfect vision. However, this test is not 100% accurate (based on users data).

                     <h5> How vision+ colorblind test works ? </h5>
                     <p>
                      This is the most common type of color blindness test. Here we will will ask you to look at an image made up of colored dots with a differently colored number or shape in the middle. If the shape blends into the background 
                      and you canâ€™t see it, you may have a type of color blindness. Different color plates can check for different types of color blindness.
