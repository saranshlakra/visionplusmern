        <h3> Sight is a complex process. More of the brain is dedicated to vision than to hearing, taste, touch, and smell combined. In this article, we explain the anatomy of the eyes and how they let us see.</h3>
        <br />
        <h5>How the visual system works:</h5>
       <ul>
        <li>Light passes through the cornea, a dome-shaped structure. The cornea bends the light to help the eye focus.</li>
        <li>The iris allows some of this light to enter the pupil.</li>
        <li>Light passes through the lens. With the cornea, the lens focuses the light onto the retina at the back of the eye.</li>
        <li>The retina converts the light signal into electrical impulses.</li>
        <li>The optic nerve carries the impulses to the brain, which processes the signals and produces the image.</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>Eye conditions</h3>
          <p>A wide range of health issues can affect the eyes. They may involve:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>genetic factors</li>
              <li>features a person is born with</li>
              <li>age</li>
              <li>other health conditions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here are some examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Achromatopsia: Also known as color blindness, this genetic condition affects the cone cells. A person has difficulty distinguishing between certain colors.</li>
              <li>Age-related macular degeneration:This causes blurry vision in the center of the visual field. It can lead to vision loss.</li>
              <li>Amblyopia: This begins in childhood and is often called “lazy eye.” One eye does not develop fully because the other, stronger eye dominates.</li>
              <li>Anisocoria: This occurs when the pupils are an unequal size. It can be harmless, but it may indicate a more serious medical problem, such as a stroke.</li>
              <li>Astigmatism: The cornea or lens is incorrectly curved, so light does not focus properly on the retina.</li>
            </ul>
